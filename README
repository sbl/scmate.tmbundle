A TextMate Bundle for SuperCollider
###################################

Work is based on http://github.com/rfwatson/supercollider-tmbundle but this implementation uses pipes for communication instead of OSC messages & you don't have to start the supercollider cocoa app to use the bundle.

Prerequisites:
* TextMate Terminal executable "mate" (Help/Terminal Usage...)
* A recent SuperCollider Installation (>3.3) installed under /Applications/SuperCollider
* If you want GUI display you have to install the SwingOSC.jar in the root (/Applications/SuperCollider) folder, which is the default anyways.

Features:
* Snippets
* Uses the native TextMate Browser to display the help
* Common commands (Recompile, Open Class File, Find References ...)

Installation:
* git clone http://github.com/sbl/scmate.tmbundle.git ~/Library/Application\ Support/TextMate/Bundles (or just double click the bundle)
* choose "finish installation" from the Bundle Menu
* Start the language with cmd+f1 (a terminal window will come up)
